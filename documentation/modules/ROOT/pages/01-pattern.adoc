== The story behind this solution pattern

{aap} (AAP) is widely used to manage a variety of environments.
In many occasions, a central AAP instance can be used to provide automation to multiple,
and distinct, customers or partners, referred to in this solution pattern as a third-party network.

The organizations behind these third-party networks are independent and they need their internal
network to remain secure and not exposed to external or public access, coming from the internet,
but they need to allow a centralized AAP instance, owned by a trusted partner, to be able to maintain
their server's infrastructure.

These organizations need an easy way to expose their target servers to be managed by the trusted partner,
and they do not want to allocate extra resources to change their network infrastructure.

== The Solution

With *{rhsi}* version 2, they can achieve that with minimal efforts, due to its
declarative nature.

The partner that uses *{aap}* (AAP) to maintain the third-party infrastructures,
has its AAP instance running on an OpenShift cluster in the public cloud.

The partner will also prepare a Red Hat Service Interconnect site bundle to be installed into the third-party
infrastructure, exposing their target servers into a specific namespace within their OpenShift cluster.
An individual namespace will be used for each third-party network so that they're isolated from other namespaces,
being accessible only to the *`aap`* namespace, where the AAP instance is running.

With that, AAP can manage the third-party servers while keeping their hosts and network protected as all the
traffic coming from AAP into their network will flow through {rhsi}, using secured mutual
TLS authentication and encryption.
