[#in_depth]
== An in-depth look at the solution's architecture

The trusted partner has a *{ocp}* cluster running on the public cloud. In this {ocp} cluster, they
have a **{aap}** (AAP) instance used to maintain third-party infrastructures.

This AAP instance runs inside the `*aap*` namespace. For their AAP instance to be able to communicate with
third-party servers, that are not accessible from the public cloud, they will use *{rhsi}* (RHSI) version 2.

A separate namespace will be created for each isolated third-party network.

Network policies will be applied to the third-party namespaces, to ensure that incoming internal traffic will only
be allowed from the `*aap*` namespace. This will ensure that unauthorized access from a separate third-party namespace,
as well as from any other namespace within this OpenShift cluster, will be denied.

Each third-party namespace will have an instance of {rhsi} (RHSI) and this instance will be responsible for receiving an incoming
RHSI link, coming from the third-party network. Once the {rhsi} link is established, using mutual TLS to ensure privacy
and security, a selected set of servers, running in the third-party network, will be exposed by an RHSI instance running
within the third-party network, into the third-party specific namespace on the {ocp} cluster.

The respective servers are then exposed as Kubernetes services within the third-party namespace, where the AAP instance
will be able to communicate with them via SSH transparently through RHSI.

Distinct inventories will be created inside AAP, for each third-party network, representing the servers to be managed.

== About the Technology Stack

{rhsi} provides access to selected workloads running in the third-party network.
In this solution pattern, we illustrate two third-party networks being managed by AAP.
One of them, represented as *_Third-party network A_* has an RHSI instance running on a *{rhel}* (RHEL) machine.

The following one, represented as *_Third-party network B_* has an RHSI instance running using *Podman*.

It is important to mention that {rhsi} (version 2+) runs on Kubernetes clusters,
{rhel} and using Podman or Docker container engines.
